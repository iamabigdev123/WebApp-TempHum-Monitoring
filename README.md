# 🌡️🌐 WebApp-TempHum Monitoring 🌡️🌐

Welcome to the WebApp-TempHum Monitoring repository! This project is a simple real-time web-based monitoring system for temperature and humidity data collected from an ESP8266 with a DHT22 sensor, integrated with Blynk.

## 📚 Description
The system allows you to monitor temperature and humidity data in real-time using a web interface. The data is collected from an ESP8266 microcontroller equipped with a DHT22 sensor. By leveraging the power of Blynk, a popular IoT platform, you can easily visualize and track the environmental conditions wherever you are.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity  
✅ Integration with Blynk IoT platform for seamless data visualization  
✅ Easy to set up and deploy on your own ESP8266 device  
✅ Web-based interface for convenient access
